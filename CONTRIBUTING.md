# Contributing Guide

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Contributions of all kinds are welcome — not just code. This guide explains how to get involved and what we value.

## Ways You Can Contribute

- Suggest new tools: Propose linters, formatters, CI/CD, testing, or other tooling that can improve quality and DX.
- Improve README and docs: Clarify setup, usage, examples, FAQs, and cross-link relevant sections.
- File issues: Report bugs, request features, or propose enhancements with clear reproduction steps.
- Triage: Reproduce issues, add missing details, label by type/priority, and suggest next actions.
- Improve project templates: Refine issue/PR templates, workflows, funding, security, or conduct docs.
- Refactor and maintain: Small cleanups, dependency updates, and non-breaking improvements.
- Tests & validation: Add or improve tests, CI checks, and coverage where applicable.

## Proposing New Tools

When suggesting a tool (e.g., linter, formatter, CI action, test framework), please include:

- Problem statement: What pain point does it solve?
- Why this tool: Rationale, alternatives considered, and tradeoffs.
- Maintenance: Expected cadence, ecosystem maturity, and configuration complexity.
- Impact: Developer experience, performance, security, and CI time.
- Scope: Minimal viable configuration to start; follow-up steps if adopted.

Create a "Feature request" issue using the template and prefix the title with "Tooling:" for clarity.

## Improving the README

PRs that improve the README are very welcome. Common improvements include:

- Clearer quickstart instructions and prerequisites.
- Usage examples and common troubleshooting notes.
- Linking to `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and this `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- Badges (build status, coverage, etc.) where appropriate.

## How to Contribute

1. Open an Issue: Start a conversation for significant changes or tool proposals.
2. Fork & Branch: Use a descriptive branch name (e.g., `docs/improve-readme-quickstart`).
3. Make Changes: Keep PRs focused and small when possible.
4. Update Changelog (optional): If your change is user-facing, add an entry under "Unreleased" in `CHANGELOG.md`.
5. Submit a PR: Use the PR template, reference related issues, and include testing/verification steps.
